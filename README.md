# Traffic-Light-with-Timer
This project replicates a traffic light system using HTML and CSS for design and JavaScript for functionality. Three lights—red, yellow, and green—are activated one by one in a 3-second cycle. After red, the yellow light turns on, followed by green. When one light is active, the other two remain off, simulating a realistic traffic light sequence.
